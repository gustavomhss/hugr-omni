//! Error message texts: what failed + the value + the likely cause + the fix (QS-05). Identical in every
//! language, because the bindings never write their own. W03.
//!
//! Each text comes with its code, as an `Error` constructor: this module is private to `error`, so callers write
//! `Error::not_on_path(..)`, and no call site can pair a text with the wrong code. Fields carry their contract
//! names (`command`, `args[i]`, `cwd`, `env`, `inheritEnv`, `timeoutMs`, `graceMs`, `pty.cols`), so one text serves
//! every language. Shared and append-only (AGENTS.md): each WP adds its own `impl Error` blocks at the end.
//!
//! Secrets: argument text and env values are never echoed, because they often carry secrets; the field and the
//! byte offset point at the problem instead. One exception, decided by the lead (UX-D): the NOT_FOUND texts of a
//! PATH lookup show the PATH and PATHEXT values that were searched, because they are the values that failed and
//! the user needs them to fix the lookup. No other env value appears in any text.
